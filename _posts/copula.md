title: Copulas in Probability Theory 
---

## Basic Concepts

The term "Copula" was first introduced by Abe Sklar in his 1959 article. It has been widely used, though not always applied properly, in financial and econometric modeling, especially in pricing securities that depend on many underlying securities.

Properties of copulas are analogous to properties of joint distributions. The \`joint distribution\` of a set of random variables $(Y_{1}, \dots , Y_{m})$ is defined as $$F(Y_{1}, \dots , Y_{m}) = \mathbb{P}\{Y_{i} \leq y_{i}; i = 1, \dots , m\},$$

(See [^1])
